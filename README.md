# React Native Demo App for MoMo (Mobile Monday)
This is a simple chat application prepared as a Demo during
React Native presentation for Mobile Monday (2017 March) held
in Kathmandu.

The app uses WebSocket for communication. The websocket server
is also available within the `server` folder. To start the server
locally run:

> `$ npm run start-server`

The client application uses Expo for easier deployment. The code
doesn't use any of the Expo components or dependencies. To run this
react-native app as is, Expo Development Environment (XDE) will be required. 
The xde could be downloaded from:

> https://github.com/expo/xde

You can also run this app using the Expo app using the following link
